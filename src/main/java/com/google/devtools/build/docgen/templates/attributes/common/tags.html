<p><code>List of arbitrary text tags.  Tags may be any valid string; default is the
empty list.</code></p>

<p>
<i>Tags</i> can be used on any rule; but <i>tags</i> are most useful
on test and <code>test_suite</code> rules.  Tags on non-test rules
are only useful to humans and/or external programs.
<i>Tags</i> are generally used to annotate a test's role in your debug
and release process.  Typically, tags are most useful for C++ and
Python tests, which
lack any runtime annotation ability.  The use of tags and size elements
gives flexibility in assembling suites of tests based around codebase
check-in policy.

<p>
A few tags have special meaning to the build tool, such as
indicating that a particular test cannot be run remotely, for
example. Consult
the <a href='bazel-user-manual.html#tags_keywords'>Bazel
documentation</a> for details.
